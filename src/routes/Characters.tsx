                Caraxes looks up at the tall, helpless fingerling.
                He's just standing there, looking after where the mistress went. <i> "I am herre.."</i>
            </p>
            <p id="ceres">
                Ceres is entirely fascinated by what he sees.
                He is uncertain how to proceed though, for he has never seen a fiend before, at least not in person.
                <i>"It is a pleasure to meet you, little mister," </i>he begins, trying to be polite while doing a quick
                bow.
                <i>"Hmm... Are you the master of Lady Morwyn and commander Minamoto? Are they your loyal servants?
                    A proper title befits a creature such as yourself, but I must admit, I do not know how to address you.
                    Will Sir Devil Baby suffice?"</i> he asks in genuine curiosity.
            </p>
            <p id="caraxes">
                Caraxes puffs himself up, finally someone to see how great he was.
                "<i>I am Caraxes, once known as Lord Al'xitar, Holderrr of the Gate,
                    Ssslayer of the Drreadhorrrrorrss and Tyrrrant of the Dawnfox Coassst.
                    Fallen in the age of the Black rain. I have been ssserrrving in Hellssss for almost 2 millenniasss
                    and I am contracted to ssserve Morwyndell Eldamar until herrr demissse.</i>"
                He proudly recites, his long line of achievements.
                Now he must only serve his contract before he ascends.
                "<i> is mistrressess new mate. And ssshe hass invited you .... To live in herrr domain.</i>"
