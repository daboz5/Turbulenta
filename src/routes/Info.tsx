                    <p>Turbulenta is a western marches inspired D&D online campaign where almost anybody can join in.
                        The game is set on an island of Turbulenta where a new colony from the Iron Rose Kingdom, or Rosa de
                        Hierro,
                        is established - the town Rosa Riendo being the main settlement.
                        After the turbulent happenings of the first season, where heroic newcomers got to battle traitors
                        and gods,
                        explore the treacherous and deadly jungles and treat with the natives, a lull of 30 years followed.
                        New blood came to the island and rebuilt what was lost in the destruction only for misfortune to
                        strike again.
                        With multiplanar thieves jumping in, stealing the priceless artifacts from the heroes and killing
                        many on the way
                        there was again time for the heroes to step up and donn their armor. But what happens when the
                        heroes don't return from their mission?
                        Second season picks up with the death of Mayor and Commander Manuel and the disappearance of heroes
                        of the past as they went to avenge him and retrieve the artifacts.
                        Newcomers, some born on the island, some freshly arrived, are there to pick up fallen mantles of
                        their mentors and leaders.
                        And as their first delve into the mysterious caverns under the island leads them to planar rifts, a
                        large planar lake and a strange being known as the Fisherman, nobody know where they'll land next.
